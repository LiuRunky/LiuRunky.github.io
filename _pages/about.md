# üëã About Me
Hi, I am Langqi Liu (ÂàòÊúóÈ∫í). 
Welcome to my homepage! 
I like coding, drawing, and various types of sports. 
I am always passionate about producing something creative yet logical. 

At present, I am visiting LARK@HKUST(GZ) as a research assistant, working with Prof. [Zhijiang Guo](https://cartus.github.io/).
I have been excited about the mechanism of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their applications.
Specifically, I am interested in LLM for code generation, which involves intensive reasoning, planning and translation between natural language and programming code.

I obtained my M.Sc. degree in Artificial Intelligence at Nanjing University, where I were fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Lijun Zhang](https://ai.nju.edu.cn/zlj/index.htm) from the [LAMDA group](https://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/MainPage.ashx). 
My research focused on designing optimization algorithms with provable theoretical guarantees. 
Prior to this, I obtained my B.E. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Southeast University in 2022. 

I stay open to connections and collaborations. 
If you are interested in my background or skills, feel free to [send an email](mailto:liurunky@gmail.com) and discuss how I can contribute to your objective.

- Reviewer: ICLR'2025

# üëæ Hobbies
- Drawing: You can find my artworks from [LiuRunkY@pixiv](https://www.pixiv.net/users/16552180) (SAI2 + WACOM CTL-472).
- Sports: Running, table tenis, basketball, tenis, swimming, football... Current PBs for running: 11'33'' (3km), 19'26'' (5km), 45'12'' (1/4-Marathon). My current goal is to complete a half-Marathon race before 2026.
- Go Chess: Amateur 3Dan (in 2009), however I rediscovered the joy of it recently. 
- Competitive Programming (Retired): [<font color="#FF8C00">LiuRunkY</font>](https://codeforces.com/profile/LiuRunkY) (Codeforces), some tutorials (in Chinese) for algorithms and data structures available in [LiuRunky@cnblogs](https://www.cnblogs.com/LiuRunky).
