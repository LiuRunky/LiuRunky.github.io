# 👋 About Me
Hi, I am Langqi Liu (刘朗麒). 
Welcome to my homepage! 
I like coding, drawing, and various types of sports. 
I am always passionate about producing something creative yet logical. 

I am currently pursuing an M.Sc. degree in Artificial Intelligence at Nanjing University, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Lijun Zhang](https://ai.nju.edu.cn/zlj/index.htm). 
My research focuses on designing optimization algorithms with provable theoretical guarantees. 
Prior to this, I obtained my B.E. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Southeast University in 2022. 

Recently, I have been excited about the mechanism of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their applications.
At present, I am also working with Prof. [Zhijiang Guo](https://cartus.github.io/) on relevent topics, and is scheduled to visit HKUST(GZ) as a research assistant since 2025 Fall.
Meanwhile, I stay open to collaborations on LLM-based projects. 
If you are interested in my background and skills, feel free to [send an email](mailto:liurunky@gmail.com) and discuss how I can contribute to your objective.
